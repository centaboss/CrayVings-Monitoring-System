# CRAYvings Monitoring System

An IoT-based smart monitoring system designed for aquaculture, specifically for **crayfish/crab pond or tank monitoring**. This project helps monitor important water conditions in real time using sensors connected to an **ESP32**, with data sent to a **web-based dashboard** for viewing and tracking.

---

## Project Overview

The **CRAYvings Monitoring System** is built to help monitor the water environment of aquaculture tanks or ponds. Since aquatic animals are highly sensitive to changes in water quality, this system provides a more efficient way to check conditions without relying only on manual observation.

The system uses sensors connected to an **ESP32 microcontroller** to collect environmental data. The readings are then sent through Wi-Fi to a backend/database and displayed on a monitoring dashboard.

This can help reduce risks caused by poor water conditions and improve overall monitoring efficiency.

---

## Objectives

- Monitor water-related parameters in real time
- Provide a centralized dashboard for viewing sensor data
- Help improve water quality management in aquaculture
- Reduce manual checking and improve consistency
- Support better decision-making for tank or pond maintenance
- Provide instant alerts (floating popups, sound, and SMS) when parameters go out of safe range
- Notify users immediately when the ESP32 device disconnects

## Features

### Core Features
- **Real-time sensor monitoring** - Temperature, pH, water level (3 sensors via ESP32)
- **ESP32-based data collection** - Wireless sensor data transmission with WiFiMulti + validation
- **Web dashboard** - Responsive React UI with icon-based navigation
- **Database storage** - PostgreSQL for historical data

- **SMS notifications** - Critical threshold alerts and device disconnect alerts via SkySMS API
- **SMS mute/sleep** - Pause SMS alerts for 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, or 24 hours
- **Disconnect/reconnect alerts** - Floating popup, sound, and activity log when ESP32 goes offline or comes back online
- **Recipient management** - Manage SMS alert recipients
- **Custom alert sounds** - Audio alerts via Web Audio API
- **PDF export** - Export system logs to PDF (LogsPage)
- **Activity logging** - Track user interactions including device connect/disconnect events
- **Smart save logic** - Only writes to database when data actually changes

## System Architecture

```
Sensors → ESP32 → Wi-Fi → Express API → PostgreSQL → React Dashboard
                     │                              │
                     ▼                              ▼
                SMS via SkySMS ←───── Alert System (popup + sound + activity log)
```

### Data Flow
1. **Sensors** read environmental data
2. **ESP32** collects and sends data via HTTP POST
3. **Express API** validates and stores in PostgreSQL
4. **React Dashboard** polls for data every 3 seconds
5. **Connection check** compares sensor data timestamp against current time
6. **Alerts** triggered when values exceed thresholds or ESP32 disconnects
7. **SMS** sent to active recipients for critical events (unless muted)

## Prerequisites

### Hardware
- ESP32 DevKit V1
- DS18B20 temperature sensor
- HC-SR04 water level sensor
- pH probe/sensor

### Software
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL 15+
- Arduino IDE (for ESP32)

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment

Create a `.env` file:

```bash
PORT=3000
PG_HOST=localhost
PG_PORT=5432
PG_DATABASE=crayvings_monitoring_system_db
PG_USER=postgres
PG_PASSWORD=your_password
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173
SKYSMS_API_KEY=your_skysms_api_key_here
SKYSMS_API_URL=https://skysms.skyio.site/api/v1
```

### 3. Start Backend

```bash
npm run server
```

### 4. Start Frontend

```bash
npm run dev
```

Dashboard opens at http://localhost:5173

### 5. Connect ESP32

Configure server URL in `esp32code.ino`:
```cpp
const char* serverName = "http://<your-server-ip>:3000/sensor";
```

---

## Configuration

### Setting Thresholds
Navigate to **Settings** to configure temperature, pH, and water level min/max values.

### SMS Mute / Sleep
Two ways to pause SMS alerts:
1. **Floating alert popup** — Click the bell icon on disconnect alerts (1h/2h/4h/6h/8h/12h/24h)
2. **Settings page** — "SMS Alert Sleep / Mute" section with all durations and unmute button

While muted, disconnect alerts still show as popups and are logged, but SMS is not sent.

### SMS Notifications
- SkySMS integration for critical alerts and device disconnect alerts
- Recipient management in Settings page
- Test SMS feature to verify configuration

### Smart Save Logic
Only writes to database when values actually change. Handles null/undefined, numeric strings, dates, and JSON objects.

## Connection & Offline Handling

### How Connection Status Works
- Frontend polls `GET /sensor/latest` every 3 seconds
- `lastUpdate` uses the **actual sensor data timestamp** (not poll time)
- If sensor data is older than 15 seconds → status = **offline**
- After 5 consecutive failed API requests → status = **offline**

### When ESP32 Disconnects
1. Sensor data becomes stale (older than 15s)
2. `error` state set → all pages show error UI
3. Floating popup: "ESP32 device disconnected — no data received"
4. Critical alert sound plays
5. Activity log: `device_disconnect`
6. SMS sent to active recipients (unless muted)

### When ESP32 Reconnects
1. Fresh data arrives → `error` cleared, status = **online**
2. Pages show live readings automatically
3. Floating popup: "ESP32 device reconnected — data restored"
4. Activity log: `device_connect`

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Backend won't start | Check PostgreSQL connection |
| No data showing | Verify ESP32 IP address |
| CORS error | Add frontend port to ALLOWED_ORIGINS |
| "Device offline" | Check ESP32 WiFi connection |
| SMS not sending | Verify SKYSMS_API_KEY in .env |
| AudioContext warning | Click anywhere on the page to unlock audio |

### Debug Commands
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
curl http://localhost:3000/sensor/latest
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/sensor -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"device_id":"TEST","temperature":25,"water_level":75,"ph":7}'
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/alert/mute -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"hours": 4}'
```
